                        Hello! My name is Alex. I'm a high school graduate with almost 2 years of computer science experience.
                        My passion for code development has led me to interests of computer science research and I am looking to learn more coding languages.
                        I am considered a good person to get along with and to work with and work best in teams, have a good sense of humor and have experience in leadership when it comes to software developing and group projects.
                        This website was made from vanilla HTML and CSS with no UI framework dependencies. All icons are provided by Font Awesome. :)

                                <span id="main_projectname_prp">ProductionRP</span> is a serious roleplay server that exists in the community of FiveM. FiveM
                                is a modified version of the original game Grand Theft Auto V that allows freedom of multiplayer gameplay without guns and havoc.
                                <span id="main_projectname_prp">ProductionRP</span> was originally an idea tossed around between a friend and I on October 2021.
                                After my original project that I was lead of, <span id="main_projectname_soe">State of Emergency</span>, shut down... we had an influx
                                of excited people join our community discord waiting to roleplay and enjoy what I can bring to the table. With this project, we utilize
                                LUA, JavaScript & JQuery, HTML, CSS and Typescript as our fuel for our scripts. The server was built from scratch, making this a custom
                                frameworked server. The image above in the header is from our last day of alpha testing with over 100+ players in a 256 player-capped environment.
                                The project is still being maintained by myself and a well-numbered development team under my wing.

                                <span id="main_projectname_soe">State of Emergency</span> was a serious roleplay server that also was in the community of FiveM under a company
                                named EvolPCGaming. I joined the team on November 2019 when I decided to learn some zModeler, a 3D modeling software, to create vehicles to use on the server.
                                I then expanded to work on LUA where I was able to become proficient at it. I then rewrote the entire framework that was originally built in 2017 to
                                fit modern LUA and FiveM-supplied natives as well as optimization to ensure players enjoy the fun with as much FPS as their client can handle.
                                When I rewrote the framework, I started becoming experienced with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and MySQL. We used PHP to handle most of our database
                                queries and backend processes thus I was able to understand portions of it. The project was shut down in October 2021.
